# Rob\[Au\]tics Sign-in 2.0

If you thought [the old one](http://hunterlightman.com) was cool, just wait
until you see this one! Using Meteor (learned last week) and leveraging MongoDB,
this version of the sign-in sheet is REACTIVE. And RESPONSIVE. And BOOTSTRAP-y.

It runs more smoothly. It’s coded more cleanly. It’s administrative functions
are more useful. It looks more... nice.

The features pretty much speak for themselves. But don’t take their word for it:
This is awesome!

## Features (as compared to v1)

* Fully functioning sign-in/sign-out system, date and times automatically logged

* Two-tier user system, with a log user for logging data, and an admin user for
  deleting and forging logs

* You can refresh the page!

* Full log history can now be read and edited by the admin

* You can shut off the computer, open it up on a different machine and
  everything is preserved!

* Searching through existing users is easy and visually appealing

* The interface is in Bootstrap, so it looks good!

* Have I mentioned you can refresh the page?

## Login details

Want to try it out on your own machine? The default login details (defined in
/server/startup.coffee) are as follows:

**User:** log | **Password:** password

**User:** admin | **Password:** securepassword
